<1>The story behind</1><br>
I've coded it a long time ago. First release was for MYAC (old fastcup anticheat). They had a giant hole that allows you to view/edit game memory through steam.
Then they updated the anticheat and I was forced to use a kernel driver. I sold a few copies and then one guy went semi-rage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ze6tQYku9BU).
You can see that he is using my creepy shaky aimbot (he edited smoothly in a config so he used lower smooth than possible to configure by cheat). After like 35 days, admins viewed his logs and all users including me were banned. 
After that I received some "popularity". Army of scammers used my media and my name to scam people. Turkish scammers treated me to cut off my head. Hundreds of beggars wrote to me to give them a cheat.
After half of the year I had 300+ people in my block list (and people still coming). I tried to delete all information about me and fastcup, but it didn't work, plus scammers started to claim my work. You may call this "success", but I never seen anything like that before. 
Those people almost completely did not understand human speech. They can't follow basic orders. I tried to explain to them that I have no cheats and I am not doing cheats. Later I managed to spoof my system and recode the cheat. But those people...
Swear to god, I never seen anything like that before. 90% of them were just beggars and wanted cheat for free. Some of them, after we agreed for conditions and price, they transferred 2 times more money to scammers (so they paid 3000RUB to the scammers instead of paying me 1500 even though they knew that I am a coder and owner of the project), and then they came back and argue with me.
Some of them, after talking with me for days, said "Well, I'll take it for 100 rubles. (which evals nothing)" even after we discussed the price 10 times. Others completely did not understand where they were texting and were communicating like cave people, "Fastcup. Cheat. Want".
I thought it was a troll army, but no. They were real people of different ages and hobbies. I realized that software development does not make sense, since the cheat will get leaked or detected very quickly and it is impossible to get any profit from that because anti-cheat developers are much smarter and more professional than me.
But I started research to understand how those people lost their humanity and ability to think/speak/understand information. I discovered that fastcup owner, Max Pain, is a Russian bandit who makes money by cheating children and destroying their future by instilling gambling addiction. He is an owner of EasyDrop - scam case roulette with 0% chanse victory.
I got this information from persons who worked both with Max Pain and SAH4R SHOW (A YouTuber with 3M subscriptions). You can proof it by checking his profiles. He got links to easydrop. You can also check it by checking website information and scripts.
I continued my search and I found out that Fastcup is not a noncommercial playground. <b>FASTCUP IS A SECRET PROJECT FOR BRAINWASHING SPONSORED BY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.</b> While you playing games, they send you special codes using noise on special frequency and showing semi-transparent image codes in a corners of a screen where you cant see them, but your brains still reads info from it.
When a writing program is done, it can be activated any moment. When activated, the victim goes into a trance and moves to the designated location where special people meet him.
They move the victim to a special laboratory where non-vital brain lobes are removed. They then envelop the victim with radiation using graphite rods from the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in order to degrade the central nervous system.
Final part - they install a special chip into the victim's brain that will receive and execute special programs when needed. Â 
Fastcup strips its victim of mind and reason, leaving only an empty, mindless shell. The brainless bodies then turn into zombies, following only the most basic instincts.
This madness should be stopped. Someone needs to destroy this empire of evil.
